# 🏥 AI Medical Diagnosis System

### Advanced Multi-Disease Prediction & Healthcare Guidance Web App

An AI-powered healthcare web application built using **Machine Learning + Streamlit** that predicts multiple diseases and provides intelligent health recommendations including diet, yoga, home remedies, emergency advice, and nearby doctor search.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI Medical Diagnosis System** is an interactive web-based platform designed to assist users in predicting various medical conditions using trained machine learning models.

This system integrates:

* 🧠 Predictive Machine Learning Models
* 📄 OCR-based Lab Report Analyzer
* 📊 Real-time Disease Prediction
* 🩺 Health Guidance System
* 📍 Nearby Doctor & Hospital Finder

The application is developed as a practical implementation of AI in healthcare diagnostics.

---

## 🎯 Diseases Covered

The system predicts the following conditions:

* 🩸 Diabetes
* ❤️ Heart Disease
* 🧠 Parkinson’s Disease
* 🫁 Lung Cancer
* 🧬 Hypo-Thyroid

Each prediction includes:

* Result (Positive / Negative)
* Probability score (if available)
* Diet recommendations
* Yoga & exercise suggestions
* Daily home remedies
* Emergency precautions
* Medication precautions
* Nearby specialist search

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔹 1. Multi-Disease Prediction

Users can manually enter medical values or upload reports to receive AI predictions.

### 🔹 2. OCR-Based Lab Report Analyzer

Users can upload lab report images.
The system extracts medical values using **pytesseract OCR** and automatically fills prediction forms.

### 🔹 3. Intelligent Health Guidance

For each disease, the system provides:

* Preventive measures
* Recommended diet
* Foods to avoid
* Yoga asanas
* Home remedies
* Emergency medical guidance

### 🔹 4. Nearby Doctor & Hospital Finder

Integrated Google Maps search for:

* Cardiologists
* Endocrinologists
* Neurologists
* Pulmonologists

Based on selected disease and location.

### 🔹 5. Prediction History

Stores user prediction records during session.

### 🔹 6. Clean & Interactive UI

Modern glassmorphism UI design with background effects and interactive components.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

The system uses **Random Forest Classifiers** trained on real-world medical datasets.

### Models Included:

* `diabetes_model.sav`
* `heart_disease_model.sav`
* `parkinsons_model.sav`
* `lungs_disease_model.sav`
* `Thyroid_model.sav`

Models are loaded dynamically from the `Models/` folder.
